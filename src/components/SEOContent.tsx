          <p>
            Win rate, sometimes called close rate, is a critical sales performance metric that measures the percentage of opportunities or deals that convert into actual sales within a given period. For B2B companies, especially those with longer sales cycles and higher-value transactions, win rate serves as a fundamental indicator of sales effectiveness and overall business health.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The formula for calculating win rate is straightforward: divide the number of won deals by the total number of closed deals (both won and lost), then multiply by 100 to get a percentage. For example, if your sales team closed 50 deals in a quarter, winning 20 of them, your win rate would be 40%.
          </p>

          <p>
            Win rates vary significantly across industries, products, sales methodologies, and company sizes. While it's tempting to seek a universal benchmark, the most valuable comparison is tracking your own win rate over time and understanding the contexts that affect it.
